## General Information
- It uses FAST API to leverage API endpoints and different HTTP requests, so when you post a target URL to the URL shortener app, you get a shortened URL and a secret key back. The shortened URL contains a random key that forwards to the target URL. You can use the secret key to see the shortened URLâ€™s statistics or delete the forwarding.
- URL's are so boring and so long, don't you want something short, that doesn't clutter your screen, and something you can keep track of to use later
- The purpose is to take a long target URL as input, and return a shortened URL
